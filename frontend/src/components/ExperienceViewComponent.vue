              "I have extensive experience in developing the backend of our system, where I focused on designing and
              implementing robust APIs, managing tokens for secure authentication processes, and ensuring seamless data
              manipulation within the database. My work involved optimizing database queries, handling user authentication
              and authorization, and integrating various services to enhance the system's overall performance and security.

              creating efficient, secure, and scalable applications."
