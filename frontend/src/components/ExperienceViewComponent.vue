                    implementing robust APIs, managing tokens for secure authentication processes, and ensuring seamless

                    manipulation within the database. My work involved optimizing database queries, handling user

                    and authorization, and integrating various services to enhance the system's overall performance and
                    security. This experience has deepened my understanding of backend development and the critical role
